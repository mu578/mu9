# mu9

A micro software algorithms template library for embedded-C. Re-introducing C++ 
procedural, object-oriented and generic programming paradigms in vanilla C, however,
the library remains container agnostic. The generic programming paradigm is supported
through C-macros i.e meta-programming for compile time code generation.

Most of the type-independent algorithm front-ends are following the same design
in mind than the STL: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm for temporary
reference.
